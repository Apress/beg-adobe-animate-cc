for Toronto's seventh annual "Zombie Walk".

from Trinity Bellwoods Park all the way up to the Bloor Cinema.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000 A:middle

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000 A:middle
where the undead are now watching a collection of zombie-themed films

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000 A:middle
supplied by their friends at the After Dark Film Festival.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000 A:middle
